The acronym tag is used in html to allow the full name of an acronym on hover.

It takes an acronym like `ASAP`	 so that when you hover over, it will show "as soon as possible". It must be noted that this effect only works if you use the title attribute which I will show you in the next section.


## Syntax

Let's take a look at the syntax:

```html
<acronym title="laugh out loud">LOL</acronym>
```

As you can see it's simple to use. Ideally you would use it inline within a paragraph but you could also use it within a header tag like so:

```html
<h1><acronym title="laugh out loud">LOL</acronym></h1>
```

### Attributes

* _title_ :<br>
	This  allows you to specify the full name for the acronym in-between the tags. This is the only attribute of the `acronym` tag.



## Special Notes

As the title implies the `acronym` tag isn't supported in html5 so there is no need to use it anymore, plus spelling acronym is a job in itself.

Instead you would use the `<abbr>` tag. It accepts the same attribute just a much shorter name like so : 

```html
  <abbr title="laugh out loud">LOL</abbr>
```

So all you need to take away from this article is use `<abbr>`tag not `<acronymd>` tag (darn spelled it wrong again) because it does the same thing with a lot less typing.

Thanks for reading this article, till next time.
