*Write a short "what it is" here. This can be a one-word definition.*

The acronym tag is used in html to allow full name of an acronym on hover. 

It takes an acronym like `ASAP`	 so that when you hover over, it will show "as soon as possible". It must be noted that this effect only works if you use the title attribute which I will show you in the next section.


## Syntax

Let's take a look at the syntax:

```html
		<acronym title="laugh out loud">LOL</acronym>
```

### Values

This is a CSS example, so each value would need it's own sub-section below.

#### Color

An explanation of the "color" value belongs here.

#### url(path)

An explanation of using `url(path)` as a value to link to an image belongs here.

## Example 1

Write a introduction to the example, sufficient to explain what the example is showing.

```
		background: green;
```

## Example 2

Write a introduction to the example, sufficient to explain what the example is showing.

```
		background: url('path_to_image.png');
```

## Example 3 - Complex

Write a introduction to the example, sufficient to explain what the example is showing.

```
		background: none 50% 25% auto contain fixed;
```

## Special Notes

Add information that you found that seemed lesser known. Common bugs, obscure bugs, important distinctions, all belong in this section.
