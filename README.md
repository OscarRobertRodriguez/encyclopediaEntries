# Project Overview

We used the jekyll now repo to create a site that host our articles. If you would like to view the articles 
in plain markdown they are located in the `_post` directory. 

The live links will be provided below to each of our articles on our jekyll blog. Each article has the author name and the date it was
created. I know this wasn't necessary but we went this way and learned something cool in the process.

I will also put a live link to the whole website.

#### _For project owners only_

##### How to set up a post

* Make your post in the the _post dir
* Name your post in the following format: `year`-`month`-`day`-`article`-`name`.md  

   Example:  2016-08-24-array-prototype.md
   
* start each post with the text below. For the `author_github` put your first name only, all small caps. 
  Jekyll will use this to print your full name to the article with the date next to it so there is no need to
  add the date to mark down. 

<pre>
---
layout: post
title: text-transform 
published: true
author_github: brian
---
 </pre>
 
 * You can also embed codepens as they will work on the jekyll site. Don't focus too much on how the post looks in plain markdown as 
 Jekyll will make it look better.
